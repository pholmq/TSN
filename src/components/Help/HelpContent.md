# 💫 Welcome to The Tychosium

The Tychosium is an interactive 3D simulation of the **TYCHOS model** of our solar system. It allows you to visualize celestial mechanics from a unique binary system perspective, where Earth serves as the reference point.

## ☼ Navigation & Viewing

### **Orbit View (Default)**

Move freely around the solar system.

- **Rotate:** Left-click + Drag
- **Zoom:** Mouse Wheel / Scroll
- **Pan:** Right-click + Drag
- **Focus:** Double-click on any object to center the camera on it
- **Context Menu:** Right-click an object to see more options

### 🌍 **Planet Camera (Surface View)**

Experience the sky from the surface of Earth or other celestial bodies.

1. Open the **Controls** menu (top right).
2. Check **"Planet camera"**.
3. Use the **Planet Camera** panel to:
   - **Select Body:** Switch between Earth, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, or Sun.
   - **Jump to Location:** Use the **Location** dropdown to instantly visit cities (e.g., _Rome, Stockholm, Tokyo_).
   - **Manual Position:** Adjust **Latitude**, **Longitude**, and **Height** manually.
   - **Look Around:** Drag the mouse to rotate your viewing angle and direction.

## ⏱ Time Controls

Control the flow of time to observe planetary motions over centuries or days.

- **Reset:** Return to the simulation start date (2000-01-01).
- **Today:** Instantly jump to the current real-world date.
- **Play/Pause:** Start/Stop the simulation (Key: `Space`).
- **Step Forward/Back:** Move time by the selected increment (Day, Month, Year).
- **Date:** Enter a Gregorian date (YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Time:** Enter a UTC time.
- **Julian Day:** Enter a scientific Julian Day number.
- **1 sec/step equals:** Adjust how fast time passes when playing. Negative numbers run the simulation in reverse.
- **Increment:** Adjust what 1 sec/step (and multiplier) equals (second, minute, hour...).

---

## 🔭 Stars & Search

- **Star Data:** Hover your mouse over any star to reveal its Name, HR Number, Magnitude, and Color Index.
- **Search:** Use the search bar (top left) to find stars by:
  - **Name** (e.g., "Sirius", "Polaris")
  - **HR Number** (e.g., "HR 123")
- **Highlight:** Selected stars are marked with a crosshair for easy tracking.

## 🛠️ Visual Settings & Tools

Use the **Controls Panel** (top right) to customize your view:

### **Visibility**

- **Planets:** Show/hide specific planets or the Moon.
- **Orbits:** Toggle orbital paths to see the geometry of the system.
- **Labels:** Toggle text labels for planets and major stars.

### **Helpers**

- **Celestial Sphere:** Show the grid of Right Ascension and Declination.
- **Ecliptic Grid:** Visualize the plane of the solar system.
- **Zodiac:** Display the zodiacal band for astrological reference.
- **Trace:** Enable **Orbital Tracing** to draw the geometric path of a planet over time (Spirograph effect).
